Azure Service Fabric Examples
=============================

This repository contains many Service Fabric examples. Each example has it's own solution in Visual Studio.

Most of the example code in this repository is compiled against the Azure Service Fabric runtime system SDK v2.3.301 and Visual Studio Tools for 2015 v2.3.201. If you do not have these tools you can get the latest SDK here:

You will also need Visual Studio 2015 with update 2 or later.
